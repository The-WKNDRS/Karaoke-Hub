# Karaoke-Hub
The objective of the Karaoke Hub project is to develop a full stack web application that connects karaoke singers with karaoke venues, DJs, and businesses. The application will allow singers to find nearby karaoke locations, receive push notifications about karaoke events, and provide businesses and DJs a platform to submit their karaoke schedules.
